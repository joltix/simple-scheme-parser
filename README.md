# Simple Scheme Parser
This parser was written in C as a university course project. While there may be fixes for both code and documentation or refactors for clarity, this parser is not intended to be extended.

Structure and initial code were provided as course material while the denser implementation details (such as [parser.c](src/parser.c)) were left as assignments.
